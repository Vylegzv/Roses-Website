        <br><br><p class="space">The favorite rose for much of the history of modern roses. They where created by hybridising Hybrid Perpetuals with Tea roses in the late 19th century. 'La France', created in 1867, is the first indication of a new class of roses. The flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, and each flowering stem typically has a single shapely bloom. The bush tends to be stiffly upright and sparsely foliaged, which today is often seen as a liability in the landscape. Hybrid teas became the single most popular class of garden rose of the 20th century; today, their reputation as being more high maintenance than many other rose classes has led to a decline in hybrid tea popularity among gardeners and landscapers in favor of lower-maintenance "landscape" roses. The hybrid tea remains the standard rose of the floral industry, however, and is still favored in small gardens in formal situations.
