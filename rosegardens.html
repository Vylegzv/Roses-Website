	    <br><br><h3 class = "space subtitle">Using Roses in Mixed Beds and Borders</h3>
	<p>Unless you intend to have a bed of only roses, you'll want to combine your roses with other plants to keep them company. There are a variety of plants that like the same conditions as roses.</p>
	<p>Companion plants serve as a living mulch, shading the soil to keep it cooler and moister and cutting down on weeds. They also serve as a buffer between plants, slowing or even stoping rose-loving pests and diseases from spreading from plant to plant.</p>
	<img class="right rose_type_img" src="http://www.rose-gardening-made-easy.com/images/IMG_1098.jpg" alt="Rose flowerbed with companion plants">
	<p>Companion plants, as a rule, should have a shallow or limited root systems that won't rob the roses of water and nutrients. They shouldn't become entangled with roses or shade them. Let the mature size of your rose help you determine where to plant any surrounding perennials and bulbs. Tall shrub roses and climbing roses are suited to the back of the bed with medium and short plants in front of them. Miniature roses, on the other hand, belong at the front of the planting, along with short perennials. Grow taller perennials, as well as trees and shrubs, behind them.</p>
	<p>Keep in mind the foliage and flower of the companion plants. They should compliment the foliage and flower of the roses. Plants with many tiny flowers, such as cranesbill, columbine, and sweet alyssum, are especially attractive.</p>

	<br><h3 class = "space subtitle">Roses in mass plantings</h3>
		<img class="right rose_type_img" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xDVKYQqUDi0/TEmLNjFEBmI/AAAAAAAADWo/ZSKQag1sE1I/s1600/DA+Rose+Garden.jpg" alt="Mass planting of roses">
    	<p>When you want to dazzle, plant a mass of roses. Mass plantings are clusterings  of roses of the same sort, such as a half dozen or more Knock Out roses, in the same spot. Mass planting is a great solution for a sunny slope, a stunning way to fill a flowerbed, and a traffic-stopping solution for a problem urban space, such as the strip between the sidewalk and street.</p>
        <p>Masses of roses ideally should be planed at recommended spacing for maximum health and vigor - they'll have good circulation and they won't compete for nutrients and water. However, if the rose cultivar is particularly disease resistant, you may want to plant the roses 10 percent closer than recommended for a lusher, fuller look.</p>
		<p>In fact, when choosing roses for mass plantings, you may want to consider only low-maintenance and disease-resistant varieties to minimize upkeep.</p>

		<br><h3 class = "space subtitle">Using Climbing, Rambling, and Pillar roses</h3>
				<img class="right rose_type_img" src="http://crazy-frankenstein.com/free-wallpapers-files/flowers-wallpapers/roses-wallpapers/american-beauty-climbing-roses-wallpaper.jpg" alt="Climbing roses on a fence.">
	    	<p>These roses can pack lots of color into a limited amount of garden space and soften buildings, arbors, and other tall structures. They are a lovely way to add vertical elements and romance to the landscape.</p>
			<p>Climbing roses can range in height from 12 to 60 feet, depending on how you choose to grow and prune them. As a rule, you'll find the largest flowers on modern climbing roses. Climbing roses are not vines and have no tendrils to hold them to vertical surfaces. Therefore, thy need supporting devices, such as trellises, to assist them in maintaining their structure and shape.</p>
			<p>Rambler roses are delightfully rampant, with some earning a title "houser eater". They are ideal for covering a large pergola, scrambling up a massive tree or chimney, covering small buildings, engulfing a rustic fence, or basically covering any large space.</p>
			<p>Pillar roses are small, well-behaved climbers. They don't grow much over 10 feet and are ideal for training onto smaller arbors as well as pillars or posts erected in the middle of flowerbeds for vertical accents.</p>
