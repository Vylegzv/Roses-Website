	 Earliest roses are known to have flourished 35 million-years ago. Fossilized rose have been discovered in Europe, and embalmed rose buds were found along with the mummies of Ancient Egypt. Therefore, it is to no surprise that from the earliest times people from around the world have held the rose close to their hearts.

	    <br><h3 class = "space subtitle">Roses in the Ancient World</h3>
	    <p>The cultivation of roses most likely began in Asia around 5000 years ago. There were found Frescoes in Crete which date to c. 1700BC illustrating a rose with five-petalled pink blooms. Discoveries of tombs in Egypt have revealed wreaths made with flowers, with roses among them. The wreath in the tomb of Hawara (discovered by the English archaeologist William Flinders Petrie) dates to about AD 170, and represents the oldest preserved record of a rose species still living.</p>

	<p>The early Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans all grew and traded in roses, which they brought with them as they traveled and conquered. As a result, roses spread throughout the Middle East and elsewhere in the Mediterranean.</p>
	<p>The Greek scientist and writer Theophrastus created the first known detailed botanical description of a rose about 300 B.C.. Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia around this time, grew roses in his garden and is credited for introducing cultivated roses into Europe, and may have influenced rose growing in Egypt.</p>
	<p>In ancient Rome patricians tended rose gardens at their homes, and public rose gardens were a favorite place to pass a summer afternoon. Records show that there were two thousand public gardens in Rome before its fall in A.D. 476.</p>

	<br><h3 class = "space subtitle">Roses in Medieval Period</h3>
		<img class="right rose_type_img" src="medieval_gardens.jpg" alt="Medieval rose gardens">
    	<p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, as Europeans struggled to survive the onslaught of armies and marauders, rose gardening became impossible for most. Charlemagne (A.D. 742-814) grew roses on the palace grounds at Aix-Ia-Chapelle, but it was primarily the monks who kept roses alive, growing them and other plants for a variety of medicinal uses. Monasteries of the Benedictine order in particular became centers of botanical research.</p>
        <p>As social conditions stabilized, roses began to reappear in private gardens. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, soldiers returning from the Crusades in the Middle East brought back tales of extravagant rose gardens, as well as sample flowers. Travel increased everywhere, and traders, diplomats, and scholars began to exchange roses and other plants. Interest in the rose was rekindled.</p>

		<br><h3 class = "space subtitle">War of Roses</h3>
				<img class="right rose_type_img" src="red_and_white_roses.jpg" alt="Red and White roses">
	    	<p>The war started when the nobles of York rose against Henry VI of Lancaster who was a feeble ruler. Edward IV, of York, replaced Henry as king. Later, Henry again became king, but lost his crown once more to Edward after the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. The Yorkists held power until Richard III lost his throne to the Lancastrian Henry Tudor. Henry Tudor married into the House of York. This personal union ended the conflict, and a new famous dynasty, the Tudors, emerged.</p>
			<p>The War of the Roses was a civil war in England that lasted from 1455-1487. The House of York adopted a white rose (R. alba), the House of Lancaster decided to take a red rose (R. Gallica). The winner of this war, Tudor Henry VII, merged his Lancastrian rose with the red rose of his York bride and thus created the Tudor Rose, the Rose of England.</p>

		<img class="right rose_type_img" src="tea_rose.png" alt="Tea rose"> 	
        	<p>The era of modern roses was established with the introduction of the first hybrid tea rose, "La France" by the French breeder, Guillot in 1867 . This variety was considered unique for a number of important horticultural reasons: it possessed the general habit of a hybrid perpetual rose, its elegant shaped buds of hybrid tea rose, and its free flowering character. By the late 20th century, more than 10,000 hybrid tea roses were bred with great success</p>
			<p>The renewed interest in the garden rose came with the 19th century empress - Josephine, wife of Napoleon Bonaparte. This ambitious woman's dream was to establish a rose garden in Malmaison containing a collection of all the roses of the world.</p>
