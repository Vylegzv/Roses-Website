	<p>Cutting roses should be chosen from varieties that produce either large, single blooms on long stems or clustered sprays that open nearly at the same time. For many gardeners, floribundas are the ideal cutting rose, with large volumes of mid- to large-sized blooms in bountiful sprays. Long-stemmed hybrid teas are the best choice for individual buds. These roses produce so-called flushes (or successions of blooms) typically spaced 3-6 weeks apart throughout the gardening season. Some varieties are more productive than others, so choose those roses that assure a continued supply of cut flowers.</p>
	<p>Of course, when it comes to selecting roses, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But equally important is the appeal and acceptance of fragrance. There are many richly scented rose varieties, so if fragrance is important to you, plant cutting roses known for having this trait. But if you prefer to avoid strong scents in your home, select some of the many light to nearly unscented roses.</p>
	<p>Be sure to water your roses regularly and fertilize them frequently to keep your plants healthy. Perform frequent inspections of your cutting garden to recognize and treat any pest or diseases as they first appear. With the right forethought and proper care, youâ€™ll be able to enjoy your roses both inside and out all season long.</p>
		
	<br><h3 class = "space subtitle">How to cut roses</h3>
		<img class="right rose_type_img" src="http://www.davidaustin.com/ProductImages/6901_X_1.jpg" alt="Roses in a basket">
    	<p>Cut roses when the plants are well hydrated. This is usually in the morning. It's a good idea to deep water the rose bushes the evening before cutting. Bring a clean bucket or a large pitcher partially filled with lukewarm water. Select plump buds that are on the verge of opening, they'll open more fully than tight buds. You can cut opened roses, of course, but they'll have a shorter vase life. Use clean, sharp pruning shears, floral snips, or a florist's knife. Cut the stem on a 45 degree angle right above the first five-leaflet leaf under the flower. You can cut some longer stems if you wish, but avoid taking off too much foliage, because the rose bush needs plenty of leaves to produce energy for more flower production. Immediately place the cut stem into the bucket of water. Once you have cut as many roses as you need, bring the bucket inside, refill it with clean water, and re-cut the rose stems at an angle under water.</p>
